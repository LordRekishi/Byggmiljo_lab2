## Test-Driven Development (TDD), Mocking/Dummy using Mockito and Unit testing using jUnit5 & AssertJ

This was our second assignment, this was meant to teach us about normal unit testing and TDD. The StringCalculcator and Bowling parts of the app were made through TDD.
The other classes were pre-made for us to write tests for. We used mockito and stubbing to make tests for these pre-made classes. 
TDD was a very interesting way of working I'm looking forward to exploring more in the future.

*Please don't judge my old newbie self too harshly. Hopefully my later projects speaks for themselves* :)
